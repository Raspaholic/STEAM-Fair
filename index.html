            <h1>Welcome the Leather of the Future!</h1>
            <p>The leather industry is very polluting and the aim of this project is to help
                spotlight a new natural leather alternative. 'Kombucha Leather' (SCOBY) is a 
                leather alternative which doesn't pollute as much compared to the leather industry 
                today.

                <h2>100% Biodegradable</h2>
                <p>SCOBY leather is 100% biodegradable! You could compost SCOBY leather which has a minimal and short lived 
                    impact on the environment compared to animal-based leather, which endues a long decomposition process that 
                    releases chemicals from the tanning process.
                </p>

            <div class="featured-item">
                <h2>Eco-Friendly</h2>
                <p>SCOBY leather doesn't go through the same tanning process as traditional leather does which means it doesn't
                    require chemicals! Traditional leather tanning requires non-biodegradable chemicals and the tanning process emits
                toxic gasses. Traditional leather tanning pollutes water from leather factories which is released into rivers.</p>

            <div class="featured-item">
                <h2>No Animal Harm</h2>
                <p>SCOBY leather's growing process is made entirely from a cellulose film produced by the bacteria while
                    animals are killed for their hyde. SCOBY grows rapidly which saves time and resources compared to traditional leather-making.

            <div class="featured-item">
                <h2>Extremely Versatile</h2>
                <p>SCOBY leather can be grown into any shape and doesn't require sewing when sticking pieces together since they glue stick together, drying as one. 
                    Animal leather can't compete with the versatility of SCOBY leather and is bound to the constraints of the animal its hyde is coming from.

            <div class="featured-item">
                <h2>Production Costs</h2>
                <p>You only need sweetened tea to grow SCOBY, making it cheaper to produce or manufacture than animal hyde. Animal products are more resource 
                    intensive compared to SCOBY leather.
