                <h1>Supplies to Make Kombucha and SCOBY leather</h1>
                <p>These are the supplies I used for my STEAM Fair
                experiment to make the Kombucha. Food dye or water
                soluble dye is optional as I didn't buy or use it in
                my experiment. The dye could be added during the SCOBY
                production to dye the SCOBY for the leather.
